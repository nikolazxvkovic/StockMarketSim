# 2022 Assignments

This repository serves as a supplementary source for assignment files.
Keep an eye out for commits on the `readme` file. Should any updates happen to the assignment descriptions, then that will be an easy way to know what changed.

## Issues

If you have any questions about the assignment description in particular (e.g. something is not clear or there is a mistake somewhere), you are highly encouraged to create an issue in this repository. That way, all students can look at the issue to see if their question/remark has already been discussed.

The title of your issue should start with the assignment name. For example, "DuQ: insert your issue title here". Also, please follow one of the provided issue templates.
